Gnomes on Stones
================

win condition: players must move their gnomes across the board from the starting positions into the opponents' starting position, designated "land"

6 moves per side per turn

gnomes can only move on land or Stones of either color

players can only move their own color gnomes or Stones

if a gnome of the other color is on a player's stone, they cannot move that Stone

if a gnome is still on the land where it's color started, and the opposing side gnome needs to be on that space for the win condition, the opposing side gnome can swap it's gnome for the opponents' gnome
